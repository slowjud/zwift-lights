# zwift-lights

A simple project to control a yeelight led strip using zwift.

The lights will pulse with your current power zone. At a semi-random interval your heartrate will pulse for 10 seconds.

If you're not currently riding it will use a heartrate of 45 and zone 1 for power.

Very Hacky. This needs a lot of work to be turned into something useful to others.
